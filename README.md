# SQL-on-Electric-Vehicle-Dataset-
This project showcases an **SQL-based analysis of an Electric Vehicle dataset**. The dataset includes insights about various EV categories, such as average electric range, short-range, medium-range, and long-range EVs. While the dataset itself cannot be uploaded due to size or privacy limitations, the SQL scripts and queries provided here allow for in-depth exploration and manipulation of EV data.

Through this project, I aimed to analyze patterns, trends, and key metrics within the electric vehicle industry using structured queries and data visualization-ready results.
